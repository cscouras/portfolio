      <p>Hi, I'm Chris Scouras and this is my portfolio site! <br />A few months ago I made
        a decision to change my career path and to pursue the goal of becoming a Full Stack JavaScript developer.
        In order to achieve that goal I am working my way through the
        <a href="https://freecodecamp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" > FreeCodeCamp </a>
          curriculum as well as  teaching myself using other resources online.
    Thus far I have earned my
    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/cscouras/front-end-certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" > Front End Development certificate </a>
     from FreeCodeCamp and am about half way to claiming my Data Visualization certification. I will
   continue to post all relevant projects so check back often or visit me on GitHub! </p>
